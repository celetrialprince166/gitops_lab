Design and implement an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline in github actions that builds, tests, containerizes a 
simple web service, pushes the image to a registry, and deploys it to an EC2 host.
Instructions:
• Create a simple app (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask) with unit tests and a Dockerfile.
• Install required github actions plugins (Pipeline, Git, Credentials Binding, Docker, SSH Agent).
• Create github actions credentials: git_credentials (optional), registry_creds, ec2_ssh.
• Pipeline stages: Checkout → Install/Build → Test → Docker Build → Push Image → Deploy 
(SSH to EC2).
• Verify successful pipeline run and application accessibility via EC2 public DNS/IP.
• Clean up residual containers/images after deployment.
